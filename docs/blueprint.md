# **App Name**: MedHotspot

## Core Features:

- PDF Ingestion: Allow users to upload PDF files of past medical exam papers from their mobile device.
- PDF Processing: Process PDFs (including scanned ones) using OCR to extract text.
- AI-Powered Topic Classification: Use Gemini AI as a tool to intelligently classify questions based on a predefined 'Master Topic List' using few-shot learning. The system should parse questions from extracted text, and understand the medical context.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated blue (#5DADE2) for a calm, professional feel, reminiscent of medical environments, yet not cliche.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F7FA) for a clean and academic look, allowing content to stand out.
- Accent color: A contrasting vibrant orange (#F39C12) for interactive elements and calls to action, providing a clear visual cue.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for a highly readable, modern, and distraction-free reading experience.
- Utilize a card-based layout on the main dashboard to provide clear visual separation for each subject.
